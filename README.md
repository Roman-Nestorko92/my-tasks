## Overview
The Task List App is a simple, user-friendly web application designed to help users manage their daily tasks efficiently. Users can add, remove, and check off tasks, with all changes being saved to local storage so that their task list persists across browser sessions.

## Features
### Add Tasks: 
Users can add new tasks using an input field and a submit button.
### Remove Tasks: 
Each task in the list has a remove button that allows users to delete the task.
### Mark Tasks as Done: 
Users can mark tasks as completed by clicking on a custom checkbox. Completed tasks are visually distinguished from pending tasks.
### Persistent Storage: 
The application uses local storage to save tasks, so the task list remains intact even after refreshing the browser or closing the tab.

### index.html: 
The main HTML file that includes the structure of the app.
### styles.css:

### script.js:
